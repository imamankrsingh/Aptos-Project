By setting up a donation plan with a defined interval, donors can ensure consistent and timely contributions, fostering continuous support for charitable causes in a decentralized manner.

## Features

  - Donors can create a recurring donation plan, specifying the charity, donation amount, and interval for the recurring donations.
- **Execute Recurring Donation**:
  - The contract ensures that donations are transferred to the charity at the specified intervals, automating the process.

## Future Scope

1. **Donation Tracking**:

   - Implement a tracking system for users to monitor the total amount donated over time.

2. **Multi-Charity Donations**:

   - Allow donors to set up recurring donations to multiple charities in one plan, supporting diverse causes.

3. **Automated Execution**:
   - Introduce full automation for donation execution without the need for manual triggering by the donor.

The **RecurringDonation** contract simplifies and automates charitable contributions, ensuring consistent support for charitable organizations in a decentralized, transparent manner.
